# Galaxy Mentorship Network (GMN)
***Mentorship...for you!***

## Welcome!
First and foremost, Welcome! 🎉 Willkommen! 🎊 Bienvenue! 🙏 सुस्वागत (Suswagat)🎈🎈🎈

This document (the `README` file) is a hub to give you some information about the
project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find
out more.

## What are we doing?
We are working on a mentorship program that drives rich learning and development for Galaxy community members.

Designed for any Galaxy members (both new and existing), this two months Gmentoring programme will equip participants (Gmentees and Gmentors) with a broad set of practical skills to boost knowledge and thrive in the Galaxy community.

We hope to increase the proficiency of members in the use of Galaxy tools and servers, contributing to open source projects as well as becoming active members of any of our channels and working groups.

## Who are we?


## What do we need?
**You!** In whatever way you can help.
